# Blended
Blended is a static website generator written in Python and licensed under the GPL 3.0 open-source license. It supports a HTML-based templating system, content written in HTML, Markdown, Textile, reStructuredText, Jade, Docx, and Plain Text. It also supports the compiliation of Sass, Less, Stylus, and CoffeeScript. Blended makes it easy to deply your websites by incuding a built-in FTP uploader. In addition, Blended is powerfully upgradeable because it has support for a Python plugin system.

There is a full step-by-step *Getting Started* tutorial on [the website](http://jmroper.com/blended/getting-started.html).

## Installing

To install Blended from PyPi (recommended) run:

`pip install blended`

To build and install Blended from source run:

`git clone https://github.com/johnroper100/Blended.git`

`cd Blended`

`pip install .`

## Running

To use Blended after you have installed it, run:

`blended init`

This will help you start up a new website. If you need help, run:

`blended --help`

and you will see all of the commands that are available.

## Building Your Site

To build the site you have created with Blended run

`blended build`

or

`blended interactive` (for on file change building)

## Working with templates

Each Blended website uses four template files:

* header.html (Required)
* footer.html (Required)
* home_page.html (Not required but the site looks better)
* content_page.html (Not required but the site looks better)
* nav(1-6).html (You can have up to 6 different nav templates. For example, `nav2.html`)

In these files you place the markup for each section to be generated.

You have some variables that you can use in your templates to pull in values while building:

* `{website_name}`
* `{website_description}`
* `{website_description_long}` (Use for long descriptions like an author bio)
* `{author_name}`
* `{website_language}`
* `{website_license}`
* `{page_content}` (Can only be used in the content_page.html template file)
* `{page_time}` (Time the page was modified)
* `{relative_root}` (Returns a relative path for the current file)
* `{random_number}`
* `{build_date}`
* `{build_time}`
* `{build_datetime}`
* `{nav(1-6)}` (Use to place navbars. You can have up to 6 different templates. For example, `{nav2}`)
* `{page_list}` (Lists all the pages in `<ul><li><a href="page-name.html">page-name</a></li></ul>` format)
* `{page_file}` (The full filename of the page. ex. `getting-started.html`)
* `{page_filename}` (the filename of the page without the .html extension. ex. `getting-started`)
* `{page_name}` (Gives the name of the current page. Makes the page name look more pretty. For example, `getting-started.html` is converted to `Getting Started`)
* `{blended_version}` (Gives Blended's current version)
* `{blended_version_message}` (Gives Blended's current version with a nice message: `Built with Blended v2.8`)
* `{comment_box}` (A fully-working comment box powered by HTMLCommentBox.com)

Wherever you put these variables in the templates, they will be replaced by the values in your config.py file. The variables must stay within the curley brackets. You can even put variables inside the content of other variables!
