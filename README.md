## Working with templates

Each Blended website uses four template files:

* header.html (Required)
* footer.html (Required)
* home_page.html (Not required but the site looks better)
* content_page.html (Not required but the site looks better)
* nav(1-6).html (You can have up to 6 different nav templates. For example, `nav2.html`)

In these files you place the markup for each section to be generated.

You have some variables that you can use in your templates to pull in values while building:

* `{website_name}`
* `{website_description}`
* `{author_name}`
* `{website_language}`
* `{website_license}`
* `{page_content}` (Can only be used in the content_page.html template file)
* `{random_number}`
* `{build_date}`
* `{build_time}`
* `{build_datetime}`
* `{nav(1-6)}` (Use to place navbars. You can have up to 6 different templates. For example, `{nav2}`)
* `{page_list}` (Lists all the pages in `<ul><li><a href="page-name.html">page-name</a></li></ul>` format)
* `{page_name}` (Gives the name of the current page. Makes the page name look more pretty. For example, `getting-started.html` is converted to `Getting Started`)

Wherever you put these variables in the templates, they will be replaced by the values in your config.py file. The variables must stay within the curley brackets.

There is a simple starter template for Blended called blended-simple. You can download it to use and take a look at from it's own [GitHub page](https://github.com/johnroper100/blended-simple).

There is also a full render managment dashboard built with Blended. You can download it from [GitHub](https://github.com/johnroper100/RenderManagementDashboard).
